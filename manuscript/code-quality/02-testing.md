## Continuous Integration

For testing your project, you can consider solutions, such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). They can test your project against different environments and browsers. The advantage of doing this is that it allows you to detect regressions. If you accept pull requests to your project, these services can help to keep their quality higher as it forces the authors to maintain their code on a higher level.

## Code Coverage

[Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) provide code coverage information and a badge to include in your README. It's a part of improving the quality of your pull requests as they should maintain the current coverage at a minimum and ideally improve it.

T> [shields.io](http://shields.io/) lists a large number of available badges. [NodeICO](https://nodei.co/) provides badges that aggregate package related information.

T> There's a [Codecov extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov-extension/keefkhehidemnokodkdkejapdgfjmijf) for Chrome that allows you to see code coverage through GitHub user interface.
