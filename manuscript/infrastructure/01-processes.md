# Processes

Each project has processes around it. Services like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) provide plenty of infrastructure you need. At minimum they provide **version control** for project source. You can also find **issue tracker** and other supporting functionality like means to accept **pull requests** against projects. Often you can host the official site of a project on these platforms.
