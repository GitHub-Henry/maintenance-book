## Travis

TODO

For testing your project, you can consider solutions, such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). They can test your project against different environments and browsers. The advantage of doing this is that it allows you to detect regressions. If you accept pull requests to your project, these services can help to keep their quality higher as it forces the authors to maintain their code on a higher level.
