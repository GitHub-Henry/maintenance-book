<img align="right" width="255" height="329" src="manuscript/images/title_page_small.png" />

Maintaining web projects is difficult. The purpose of this book is help you to maintain your projects and gather good practices into a single place. You can [read the book online](http://survivejs.com/maintenance/introduction/).

## How to Use This Repository?

You can read the content easily through [the book site](http://survivejs.com/maintenance/introduction/). It is also available within the `manuscript` directory of the repository.

The book is developed under the `master` branch. It contains the source of the most recent development version. Each version has been tagged so that it's easy for you to find the source matching to the version of the book you are reading.
